## Reflection
So far the hardest project in terms of really managing complexity. 
Had to rewrite code many times because I felt it was too disorganized
and did not fit the best practices of modular programming. The current code
is cleaner than what I had in the first place, but improvements can still be made
to really reduce the amount of side effects.
